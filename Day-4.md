## 📘 Day 4 – Learning Log  

**📅 Date:** 15/02/2026  

### 📌 Overview  
Today, I focused on understanding Time Complexity and Space Complexity more clearly and began studying Arrays in Java. The goal was to build a stronger foundation for structured DSA learning.

### 📚 Topics Covered  

#### 🔹 Time Complexity  
- Basic idea of algorithm efficiency  
- Understanding Big-O notation  
- Difference between O(1), O(n), and O(n²)  
- How loops affect time complexity  

#### 🔹 Space Complexity  
- Memory usage of variables  
- Additional space used by arrays  
- Difference between constant space and linear space  

#### 🔹 Arrays (Introduction)  
- Array declaration and initialization  
- Taking input in arrays  
- Traversing arrays using loops  
- Accessing elements using index  
- Basic operations like finding sum and maximum element

### ❌ Challenges Faced  
- Initially confused about how nested loops increase time complexity  
- Needed practice to clearly understand how memory grows with input size  

---

### ✅ Outcome  
Gained better clarity on how algorithm efficiency is measured using time and space complexity. Also developed a basic understanding of arrays, which is an essential step toward starting structured DSA practice.
